# SoundProgramming
The key concepts in audio programming, with an emphasis on sound generation.


# #AboutTheProject
These are mini projects and main project (Pong Game). The aim is to go in-depth into sound programming (sound basics, signal processing, sound in games, sonic interaction design and procedural sound).

# #Pong Game

Main goal is to create the sound design for a game, using programming techniques in p5.js.

## 1. Pong code
Create a Pong game

## 2. Background sounds
Add foreground and background sounds (at least 2 of each). Obtain the necessary
sounds.

## 3. Sound Processing
Combine each sound with a sound processing method â€“ for example: rate, filter, delay
or reverb.

## 4. Sound Mapping
Manipulate sounds by mapping it to a parameter in the game.

## 5. Sound based on a parameter
Manipulate sound based on a random parameter.

## 6. FFT or Amplitude
Manipulate graphical element based on sound analysis methods, such as
FFT or Amplitude.

## 7. p5.Sound library
Explore further techniques in p5.Sound library.

## 8. Explanation
Comment the code to explain the additions made.

# #FurtherContributionsAndCurrentBugs
- The foreground sounds could be less repetitive.
- The FFT analysis graphic could have been more purposefully integrated in the game. 

# Comments
This is an ended project.
